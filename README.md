# Introduction:

    Our project focuses on building a single music-focused web application based on Amazon Web Service. After registering and logging in to the web application through email or social media account, the users are able to search by album name, key word, album cover as well as upload album covers. With one album page open, users can play the music in or comment on it conveniently. Their comments should be saved and be visible for later users. It is also implemented with an intelligent chat bot which can recommend music list based on usersâ€™ mood, condition, music preference and so on. In the end, it is easy to contact us in real time in case there are any suggestions given to us. Our project mainly use IAM, Cognito, SES, Lambda, API Gateway, SQS, S3, DynamoDB, Elasticsearch, Rekognition, Amazon Lex to implement.
